Text classification and prediction with a Convolutional Neural Network, a Bidirectional LSTM and a Transformer trained on the 140m strong Amazon review dataset using word vectors. This was actually one of the last tasks on Y-Data's NLP course. It's interesting to compare three 'evolutions' of neural nets - with the final implementation a SOTA distilBert. All networks written in Pytorch.
