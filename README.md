# project portfolio - Gal Moore

 My name is Gal, I have an MSc in Computer Science from University College London and recently completed Y-DATA's intensive 10 month course focusing on deep leraning, computer vision and NLP. 

 I've worked as a data scientist and deep learning engineer for the past 3 years and always on the look out for new projects and great people for new projects.<br>

I'm available to connect on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/galmoore) or through [email](gal@galmoore.co.uk).

## Summary
Over the years I've worked on a broad range of robotics, computer vision, Natural Language Processing and data science challenges. Most are confidential - for example optimization of Convolutional Neural Networks for deployment at split second execution, or integrating object detection algorithms in resource scarce underwater robots. Please see a small selection below of fun projects that I did primarily for fun and learning.

### [Social robot](https://github.com/GAL_LINK1)
- Social robotics project I initiated in partnership with Intel and toilab Tel Aviv to create a social robotics platform that integrates computer vision, speech to text, a chat bot and text to speech on one easy to use python platform. 

### [Text classification](https://github.com/GAL_LINK1)
- Text classification with CNN, BiLSTM and Transformers
 of this particular dataset for the y data course. as part of the NLP unit. Interesting comparison of performance of CNN and LSTM on text classification  with SOTA distilBert.

### [Rasbperry Pi](https://github.com/GAL_LINK1) 
- Since moving to Tel Aviv with my wife, we've been suffering from continuous tresspassing from our pet dog Shmoops. Every time we left the house we would return to smelly sheets. So I created this Raspberry pi based system to notify us of the violation and rectify the naughtiness in real time.

### [CNN for image segmentation](https://github.com/GAL_LINK1)
- As part of my work with Healthy.io I implemented a convolutional Neural Network for the purpose of segmenting chronic wounds in RGB images. This included collecting the dataset, tagging it, training the model on the cloud, testing and deploying. [Healthy.io](https://healthy.io/) is an amazing company and a fantastic place to work.

### [UK accidents EDA](https://github.com/GAL_LINK1)
- One of our projects for Y-Data was to epxlore UK traffic accident data. I attempted, unsuccesfully, to find features that accurately predict the cause of fatal accidents.

### [Colour clustering](https://github.com/GAL_LINK1)
- Use of the K-means algorithm, implemented by sk-learn, 

### [Text mining](https://github.com/GAL_LINK1)
- twitter data from xxx...
