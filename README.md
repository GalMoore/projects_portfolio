## Portfolio projects

 Hey I'm Gal. I've worked as a data scientist and deep learning engineer for the past 3 years and always on the look out for new projects and great people to work with and learn from.<br>

I'm available to connect on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/galmoore) or through [email](gal@galmoore.co.uk).

Over the years I've worked on a broad range of robotics, computer vision, natural language processing and data science challenges. Most recently on optimization of Convolutional Neural Networks for deployment at split second execution, and before that integrating object detection algorithms in resource scarce underwater robots. I also generally like to keep busy learning new technologies and solving real world problems.  You can see some examples below.

### [Social Robot](https://medium.com/@Gushu/toybot-open-source-social-robot-faebc17c2700)
- Toibot is a social robotics project I initiated in partnership with [Intel Israel](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/corporate-responsibility/intel-in-israel.html) and [toilab](https://en.toilab.org/) to create an open-source platform that integrates computer vision, speech to text, a chat bot and text to speech on one easy-to-use python platform. 

### [Text Classification](https://github.com/GalMoore/projects_portfolio/tree/master/Text_Classification)
- Text classification and prediction with a Convolutional Neural Network, a Bidirectional LSTM and a Transformer trained on the 140m strong Amazon review dataset using word vectors. This was actually one of the last tasks on Y-Data's NLP course. It's interesting to compare three 'evolutions' of neural nets - with the final implementation a SOTA distilBert.

### [Rasbperry Pi](https://github.com/GalMoore/Shmoopi_Trap/tree/master/Shmoopi_trap/RaspiSecurity) 
- Since moving to Tel Aviv with my wife, we've been suffering from continuous tresspassing from our pet dog Shmoops. Every time we left the house we would return to smelly sheets. So I created this Raspberry pi based system to notify us of the violation and rectify the naughtiness in real time.

### [CNN for Image Segmentation](https://github.com/GalMoore/projects_portfolio/tree/master/CNN_for_Image_Segmentation)
- As part of my work with Healthy.io I implemented a convolutional Neural Network for the purpose of segmenting chronic wounds in RGB images. This included collecting the dataset, tagging it, training the model on the cloud, testing and deploying. [Healthy.io](https://healthy.io/) is an amazing company and a fantastic place to work.

### [UK Accidents EDA](https://github.com/GAL_LINK1)
- One of our projects for Y-Data was to epxlore UK traffic accident data. I attempted, unsuccesfully, to find features that accurately predict the cause of fatal accidents.

### [Colour Clustering](https://github.com/GAL_LINK1)
- Use of the K-means algorithm, implemented by sk-learn, 

### [Text Mining](https://github.com/GAL_LINK1)
